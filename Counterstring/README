https://github.com/jamesmartin/counterstring/

Orginal Counterstring implementation made by James Bach can be downloaded at http://www.satisfice.com/tools.shtml (perlclip)

Counter strings are self documenting strings with respect to their length. CounterString is a class that creates counter strings of arbitrary length.

James Bach[1], describes them as follows:

"A counterstring is a graduated string of arbitrary length. No matter where you are in the string, you always know the character position. This comes in handy when you are pasting huge strings into fields and they get truncated at a certain point. You want to know how many characters that is."

In demostration.php you can find a basic implementation of the CounterString.php class.
